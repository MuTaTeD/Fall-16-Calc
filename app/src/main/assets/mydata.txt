Stir-Fried Rice with Chinese Sausage
While slices of Chinese sausage are good in any stir-fry, my favorite way to use them is in a rice or noodle dish, so the staple soaks ups the fat rendered from the sausage. Used in fried rice, the sausages impart a rich taste to each kernel.

Five-Spice Chicken Wings Recipe
The sweet heat from the Chinese five-spice powder may not be what you typically think of in terms of incendiary wings, and the crisp skin comes from the blast of a hot oven rather than the splattering of hot oil. Yet we’re quite, quite taken with them all the same. Wingdings for dinner.

Korean Rice Cakes (Dok Boki)
Rice cake, called tteok in Korean, is a much-loved traditional dish with many many variations. No festival day, anniversary, or celebrations is complete without them. They are very chewy, and may be an acquired taste, but once you get hooked you'll crave them all the time.

Dump Cake
Don’t let the name scare you. It’s a really simple dessert — usually made with a base of cake mix + fruit filling — where, true to its name, you can dump the ingredients into a pan, give it a stir, and bake.

Sugar Cookies

Creamed Candy Corn
The resulting candy corn slurry is certainly one of those dishes that straddles the line between awful and awesome: that is to say, you might just like it, but you probably wouldn't confess that to your foodie friends.

Buttermilk Creams with Strawberries
Whipped cream gives these no-bake eggless custards a delicate texture. Don't worry if the mixture forms clumps at first -- it will come together with gentle folding.
